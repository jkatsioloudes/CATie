Smart, Human-Centered Education Platform for Imperial College, Team of Six.  This latest version of this software is closed source and currently maintained from the university.  In this repo I have posted an old iteration (which even includes a package vulnerability) to demonstrate part of my work.  This version is not maintained any more.

## Motivation
Replaced the previous 16-year-old system and improved user experience through iterative feedback from students and staff.  Developed and Tested 33% of Back End using Django including Scheduling with Google and Outlook Calendar integration.
